Using socket programming, implement the following problem.
The server should be able to keep
track of upto 10 simultaneous users.
First client that connects the server will
have privilege to send a C source file to the server.
The server will then compile, execute and send the output
to all the clients connected to the server.
All the clients(except the first one)
should stay only in the listen state.
