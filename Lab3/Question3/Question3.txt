Assume that there two servers, A and B,
which store a 10MB file that is split into 10 parts.
Client 1 requests the file to server A which replies
to client 1 with 5 chunks of the requested file,
which are randomly selected.  Later on,
client 1 identifies the missing chunks and it requests
the missing chunks (and only them) to server B.
Moreover, the Client 1 can request 1 piece of chunk at the same.
Once all the chunks are received,
Client 1 sends the THANKS message to both of the servers.
